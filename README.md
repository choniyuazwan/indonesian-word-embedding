# Indonesian Word Embedding
A web application that demonstrates Indonesian word embedding, inspired by [Word embedding demo](bionlp-www.utu.fi/wv_demo/).

See the demo: http://indonesian-word-embedding.herokuapp.com

Right now it serves pre-trained word vectors from [here](https://github.com/Kyubyong/wordvectors). The word vectors are trained on the Word2vec model from Wikipedia texts using the CBOW training algorithm. 

## üí° future improvements
- **Refactoring**. This is my time using Vue so I'm sure there are a lot of things to be refactored that I haven't known yet!
- **Serves multiple models**. Not only Word2vec using CBOW but also Word2vec using skip-gram or even FastText.
- **Add more in-depth explanations**, possibly for each section.
- As more explanations are added, **consider using Vuex**.
- **Indonesian translation**.
